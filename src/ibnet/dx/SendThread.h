 * next buffer/data to send. If data is available, it fills one or, if enough
 * data is available, multiple pinned infiniband buffers and posts them to the
 * infiniband work queue. Afterwards, the same amount of work completions are
 * polled for optimal utilization. However, handling flow control data is
 * prioritized and always comes first to avoid deadlocking.
